run make all, in terminal at project fie location

then run ./wireview <Paramater 1: should be 1 of the four pcap files>

Program output: prints out a timestamp, then a the information for every packet, then hello world, then total packets, and total packet capture time

running make clean, will delete all executable files

Also FYI there is a limit of 10000 packets that the pogram can process
