Project Descriptions: https://ia.wpi.edu/cs3516/resources.php?page=show_project&id=3

Final for P2:

Completed Tasks:

Tasks 1&2 are fully completed, Tasks 3-5 are completed for the parsing of each packet(print statements prove this), task 6 is not attempted

For task 3-5 we did not filter for unique addresses and ports, this psuedocode is in the wireviewNotFunctional.cpp file

How to run:

run make all, in terminal at project fie location

then run ./wireview <Paramater 1: should be 1 of the four pcap files>

Program output: prints out a timestamp, then a the information for every packet, then hello world, then total packets, and total packet capture time

running make clean, will delete all executable files

Also FYI there is a limit of 10000 packets that the pogram can process
